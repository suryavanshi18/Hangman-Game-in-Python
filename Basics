Dimension->contain qualitive values, categorize data
Measures->Contain numeric ,aggregate->sum
Dimensions(blue) and measures(green) come under role
Discrete represented as blue, continuous as green
Types of filter->extract, data source, context, dimensions, measures, calculation filter
Join vs blending->Combining data from 2 or more sources(oracle, sql) is called data blending, each data source has its own set of dimensions,  measures
Combining data between 2 or more tables/sheets within same data source is called data joining.
Live vs extract->in live conn offer the convenience of real time updates with any changes in data source reflected in Tableau.Extract are snapshots that are loaded into system memory to be quickly called for visualization
Extract is faster as it doesn’t need to access the db
Calculated field->avg(datediff(‘day’,[m1],[m2]))
Top 5 and last 5->Can be made using set   Dimension->create->set
Set vs group->group is one D,used to create high level category by using lower category
Tableau sets can have conditions and can be grouped across multiple dimensions
Groups can’t be used in calculated field but sets can
Parameter->dynamic values that can replace constant values in calculations,filters
Parameter->right click->show parameter control
Twbx->tableau packaged workbook (Package of files compressed together),contains datasource also
Twb->xml contains instructionto interact with data source,can’t be shared alone
Workbook->contains sheet,worksheet,story,dashboard
Worksheet->contains single view along with shelves.legends,data pane
Dashboard->collection of multiple worksheets
Story->contains sequence of worksheets
Blended axis->2 measures that  have same axes,have the same scale and axis
Dualaxes-> 2different scales,allows you to compare measures,
Left(3,”Tableau”)->error
Left(“Tableau”,3)->Tab
How to handle Null values->Tableau cannot plot them->filter data,show data at default location in axis
Measures->add table calculation->rank
Calculated field->sum([Profit])/sum([sales])
Rank->rank(sum([Sales]))
Dashboard Action->url action
Objects->url
To show aggregated sales across range of products->tree map
Show activities of events->gantt chart
Quarter wise profit growth->waterfall chart
Null values on map->edit location,filter data,show data at default location
Lod->level of detail ->exclude,include,fixed
{exclude[sub-category]:sum([sales])}
Profit per day->{fixed[order date]:sum([profit])}
IF [LOD-PROFIT PER DAY]>2000 then “Highly Profitabe”
ELSEIF [LOD-PROFIT PER DAY]<=0 then “Unprofitable”
ELSE “Profitable”
END
Schedule a workbook in tableau after publishing it->tableau server->content->data sources->select check box for data source->actions->extract refresh->schedule refresh
Zn->returns if it is not null otherwise zero
Find->string,substring
Datediff(‘day’,start,end)
Create parameter->sales/profit
Create calculation->case [sales/profit]
		When “sales” then [Sales]
		When “profit” then [Profit]
		end
